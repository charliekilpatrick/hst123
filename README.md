## Installation

**1. Environment (recommended: Conda)**  
From the repo root:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hst123
```

**2. Pipeline and heavy deps**

```bash
pip install drizzlepac stwcs
pip install -e .
```

The `hst123` command is available. Download, alignment, and drizzling work without DOLPHOT.

**3. DOLPHOT (only for `--run-dolphot`)**  
DOLPHOT is external; not bundled. With **conda activated**, the helper downloads sources and PSF/PAM reference data under **`$CONDA_PREFIX/opt/hst123-dolphot`**, runs **`make`**, and symlinks **`dolphot`**, **`calcsky`**, and the mask/split tools into **`$CONDA_PREFIX/bin`** so they are on `PATH`:

```bash
conda activate hst123   # or your env with hst123 installed
hst123-install-dolphot
```

Without conda (or to choose a location), pass **`--dolphot-dir /path/to/dolphot`**; use **`--no-link-conda-bin`** and **`export PATH="/path/to/dolphot:$PATH"`** if you do not want links in the env `bin/`. Manual install: [americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot](http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/).

**`calcsky` and drizzled FITS:** Per the [DOLPHOT User’s Guide](http://americano.dolphinsim.com/dolphot/dolphot.pdf) (§4.1 *calcsky*), the sky map is built with an iterative mean and standard deviation. **NaN** (common in drizzled mosaics) and **multi-extension** drizzle products (**PRIMARY + HDRTAB**) can make the `calcsky` binary abort (e.g. **SIGTRAP** on macOS). The pipeline runs `calcsky` on a temporary **single-HDU** copy with non-finite pixels replaced by the median of finite values, then moves the resulting **`*.sky.fits`** beside your science image. For **very large** drizzled mosaics (default: more than **6×10⁶** pixels), the external `calcsky` binary is **skipped** and a **Python** sky map is built immediately (override with **`HST123_CALCSKY_MAX_PIXELS`**; set **`0`** to never skip). If `calcsky` still fails, the same **Python** fallback runs (`hst123.utils.dolphot_sky`).

Use **`--all-psfs`** for the full filter set; **`--no-make`** / **`--no-psfs`** as needed. The installer logs **step-by-step progress** (what is downloading, extracting, building, and linking) via **`hst123.utils.logging`** (stderr when using the CLI); **`--quiet`** keeps only DEBUG-level detail for those lines. Re-running the same command **does not re-download** sources or PSF archives that are already installed (metadata under **`.hst123-dolphot/`** in the install tree). For PSFs it also skips when matching **`.psf`** (and PAM **`.fits`**) files are already present under the install tree (e.g. **`dolphot2.0/acs/data/`** or **`WFC/`**), not only when the stamp file exists. Use **`--force-download`** to fetch everything again. See **`hst123-install-dolphot --help`**. The helper fetches **DOLPHOT 3.1** (the **3.0** tarballs often return **HTTP 403** from the server).

**Apple Silicon (arm64) — build DOLPHOT:** You need **Apple’s Xcode Command Line Tools** (`xcode-select --install`) and **Homebrew `libomp`** for the OpenMP link step: **`brew install libomp`**. The installer uses **`-Xclang -fopenmp`** in **`THREAD_CFLAGS`** and, when **`/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp`** exists, sets **`THREAD_LIBS`** to **`-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib -lomp`** so the linker does not pick a wrong-arch **`libomp`** (e.g. **x86_64** under **`/usr/local/lib`**). If **`make`** fails with undefined **`___kmpc_*`** / **`omp_*`** and **`ld`** warns about ignoring **`libomp.dylib`**, remove or avoid that stale library and re-run **`hst123-install-dolphot`**.

**Sources and build:** By default it downloads the **base** tarball plus **ACS, WFC3, WFPC2, Roman, NIRCam, NIRISS, MIRI, and Euclid** module archives and **merges** them into one directory (same layout as unpacking each into the DOLPHOT root). It then **uncomments** the upstream **`Makefile`** `export` lines for **multithreaded OpenMP** (`THREADED`, `THREAD_CFLAGS`, `THREAD_LIBS`) and **all of those modules** (`USEWFPC2`, `USEACS`, `USEWFC3`, `USEROMAN`, `USENIRCAM`, `USENIRISS`, `USEMIRI`, `USEEUCLID`), and runs **`make`** in the directory that contains **`Makefile`** (including nested **`dolphot3.1/`** if present). On **macOS (Intel)**, Homebrew **`libomp`** is under **`/usr/local/opt/libomp`**; the same **`THREAD_LIBS`** logic applies when that path exists. **`--hst-modules-only`** limits downloads and Makefile flags to **HST only** (ACS/WFC3/WFPC2). **`--no-threaded`** leaves the threading lines commented.

**macOS:** If `pip install drizzlepac` fails (e.g. HDF5), install with Homebrew: `brew install hdf5 c-blosc`, set `HDF5_DIR` and `BLOSC_DIR`, then retry.

**Without Conda:** `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`, then run the same `pip` steps above.

## Usage

```bash
hst123 <ra> <dec> [options]
# Example:
hst123 12:30:00 -45.0 --download
```

- **`--work-dir`** — Absolute path is recommended; defaults to the current directory at startup. **`--raw-dir`** defaults to **`<work-dir>/raw`** (science FITS are written there, then copied into the work directory for reduction). **MAST / astroquery staging** (the temporary **`mastDownload`** tree) is always created under **`<work-dir>/.mast_download_staging/`** and removed after each file is moved to **`raw`** or **`--archive`**, so nothing is left in the directory you launched the command from when **`--work-dir`** points elsewhere.
- **`--download`** — Fetch data from MAST for the given RA/Dec (5′ radius). Use **`--token`** for private data ([MAST auth](https://auth.mast.stsci.edu/info)).
- **`--run-dolphot`** — Run DOLPHOT (requires DOLPHOT on PATH).
- **`--scrape-dolphot`** — Extract photometry at the target from DOLPHOT output.

Run in a directory that will hold (or already holds) your images. Without `--download`, hst123 uses existing files in the working directory. Full option list: **`hst123 --help`**.

### Logging

Package output for **`hst123`** and **`hst123-install-dolphot`** goes through **`hst123.utils.logging`**: use **`get_logger(__name__)`** and **`log.info` / `warning` / `error`** instead of **`print`**. The CLI calls **`ensure_cli_logging_configured()`** so a formatted handler is attached to **stderr** if none is present yet.

After **`--work-dir`** is known, the pipeline also creates **`<work-dir>/logs/`** and writes a session file **`hst123_pipeline_<timestamp>_<pid>.log`** with the same formatted records as the console (see **`attach_work_dir_log_file`** in `hst123/utils/logging.py`). **AstroDrizzle**, **photeq**, **TweakReg shift files**, and **`headerlet.log`** are written under **`<work-dir>/.hst123_runfiles/`**, replayed into the session log, then **deleted** (no **`photeq.log`** / **`astrodrizzle.log`** in the work root). Common drizzle scratch files (**`staticMask.fits`**, **`skymask_cat`**, headerlets, etc.) are removed. Use **`--keep-drizzle-artifacts`** to leave those in the work directory.

- **`HST123_LOG_LEVEL`** — default **`INFO`** (compact: few blank lines, one-line startup summary, no multi-line **`HDUList.info()`** dumps). Set **`DEBUG`** for **`@log_calls`**, TweakReg shift-file reads, per-file **`TWEAKSUC`** checks, input-list tables, MAST try-lines, WCS key updates, cache clears, and similar detail.
- **`HST123_REPLAY_SUBLOGS`** — default (**unset** or **`1`**) echoes every line of replayed sublogs into the session log. Set **`0`**, **`false`**, or **`summary`** for a **one-line summary** per file. The pipeline **always** folds AstroDrizzle and photeq runfiles into the session log with **compact whitespace** (this is independent of the env var for those two steps).
- **`HST123_SKY_NUMBA`** — set to **`1`** / **`true`** to use a parallel **Numba** median filter for the large-image Python sky path (when **`numba`** is installed); default is **SciPy** `median_filter`.
- File logging and other options: **`HST123_LOG_ENABLE_FILE`**, **`HST123_LOG_DIR`**, etc. (see **`LogConfig`** in `hst123/utils/logging.py`).
- Third-party libraries may still write directly to the terminal.

**External executables** (`dolphot`, `calcsky`, `*mask`, `splitgroups`, `make` in the DOLPHOT installer): stdout/stderr are captured and streamed through the same logging handlers (see `run_external_command` in `hst123/utils/logging.py`). DOLPHOT console text is still written to the usual `.output` / `.fake.output` file via a tee.

**Calibration reference files (WCS / `updatewcs`):** Before `stwcs.updatewcs`, hst123 **aligns SIP headers** on disk: if SIP polynomial keys (`A_ORDER` / `B_ORDER`) are present but `CTYPE*` are `RA---TAN` / `DEC--TAN` without the `-SIP` suffix (common on MAST ACS/WFC3 images), it rewrites them to `RA---TAN-SIP` / `DEC--TAN-SIP` so astropy/stwcs stop emitting long SIP inconsistency messages. **`WCSNAME=TWEAK`** is applied only on **`SCI`** extensions before drizzle (not on every HDU), reducing duplicate-name warnings from `stwcs.wcsutil.altwcs`. During `updatewcs`, astropy/stwcs loggers are raised to **ERROR**, `FITSFixedWarning` is ignored, and C-level **stdout** is suppressed so AstrometryDB / IDCTAB chatter does not flood the console.

The pipeline downloads small FITS tables (e.g. IDCTAB, NPOLFILE) into **`<work-dir>/cals/`** and points headers at those paths. Downloads use **HTTPS** first: HST CRDS and the **`https://ssb.stsci.edu/cdbs/`** mirror (with **`jref` / `iref` / `uref`** paths — not the legacy **`jref.old`** segment, which 404s over HTTPS). **FTP** is only tried last and is often blocked on campus networks. If you already use CRDS locally, set **`jref`**, **`iref`**, or **`uref`** to your cache directory so files are **copied** instead of fetched.
